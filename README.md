# super dev friends, huzzah!

sdfh if a space to post events, ideas for events, and comments on each of those. It has been developed for a closed group of developers and tinkerers, largely out of a desire to not pay money for a meetup account/page.

It is built using the Bottle microframework and Python 2.7. It is designed for use with an Apache server via mod_wsgi. I have deliberately built it without the use of any JavaScript (CSS and Python only). It is intended to have a web 1.0 feel. As such, it is a little more of a pain to use, though I hope to improve it over time (via the addition of user requested features) while retaining its aesthetic.

Current modern touches include an integration with Slack into the groups slack channel.
